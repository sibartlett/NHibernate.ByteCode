ByteCode Providers for NHibernate 3.3.1
=======================================

This repository contains the Bytcode Provider projects that were deprecated in NHibernate 3.2:

* NHibernate.ByteCode.Castle
* NHibernate.ByteCode.LinFu (now the default NHibernate proxy implementation)
* NHibernate.ByteCode.Spring

The source code was taken from the NHibernate 3.1 release, and updated to work with NHibernate 3.3.1.
